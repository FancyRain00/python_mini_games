This is an app called Mini Games that contains a couple of games.
It is possible to add games later on. Right now it has two games:
Tic-Tac-Toe and Rock-Paper-Scissors.
When you start the game, you are welcomed with the menu window. you can
either choose 'Choose Game' or 'Quit' to stop the program.
If you choose the first option, you are greeted with the game options window,
where you can choose the game you want to play.
The games are straightforward and pretty self explanatory. Although to know
how the game works there is a 'Help' button explaining everything.
Whatever window you are on, if you press menu or 'X:button' to exit, you are
directed to the menu window where you can either choose a new game or exit.

disclaimer for TA: The code was mostly made by myself. The way to change
windows and how to change what 'X:button' does is what I looked up.
In my opinion this should be more than enough for the Advanced GUI.
I could've used Menu() or other factors of the Advanced GUI, but for a game,
Buttons seemed more suited for the job.
